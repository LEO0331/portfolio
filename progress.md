# Portfolio Progress Log

## Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-10-01

**Active work:** Project-name, description, and preview refresh

**Status:** Verified catalogue update; local changes ready for review and deployment

### Completed

- Audited all 38 displayed projects against the public GitHub owner listing, resolved repository redirects, current READMEs, package metadata where stacks changed, and public demos.
- Updated 28 display names and curated outdated English/Traditional Chinese descriptions, roles, stacks, categories, and features.
- Resolved four renamed repositories without adding duplicates: sharpface → cna-practice; amazon-app → family-cabinet; email_website → competition-practice; RobotFriends → Gridline.
- Preserved project IDs/slugs so existing portfolio detail links remain stable.
- Refreshed 29 visually reviewed live-demo PNG previews and their preferred WebP versions, including all renamed display entries, CraftFocus, and Taipei Public Records Explorer.
- Updated existing browser-test copy expectations to match current project names and localized wording.

### Verification Evidence

- Initial and final GitHub sync dry runs reviewed; final: 0 existing updates, 0 new candidates, no missing repository warnings.
- npm ci and npm audit: passed, 0 vulnerabilities.
- npm run test:unit: 7/7 passed.
- npm run build: passed, including TypeScript checking and static route generation.
- npm run test:e2e: 23/23 passed; 17/17 tracked flows (100%).
- Data validation: 38 unique IDs and slugs; all demo/repository URLs and preview references valid; localized keys resolve to existing projects.
- Visual review: 29 loaded public-demo captures passed at 97/100; loading-only and Render wake-up captures were rejected and replaced after initialization.
- Harness and diff checks: recorded in the dated history entry after final verification.

### Blockers

- None. Initial sandbox subprocess restrictions were resolved through approved build/browser execution.

### Remaining Risks

- Public demos can load slowly or cold-start; screenshots are verified snapshots from 2026-10-01.
- Changes are local and have not been published to GitHub Pages.

### Next Session Should

1. Review the local catalogue and refreshed images, then deploy through the existing GitHub Pages workflow when requested.
2. Continue checking READMEs/live titles and GitHub redirects alongside sync: the existing sync only updates demo URLs and does not detect product-name or description changes.

## Update Contract

When project data, assets, dependencies, routing, CI, or maintenance workflows change:

1. Update **Current State** so the next session can restart without chat history.
2. Append a dated entry below; do not delete prior entries unless they are factually wrong.
3. Include commands actually run and their outcomes.
4. Record incomplete verification and remaining risks explicitly.

## History

### 2026-08-27 — Whole-project anti-slop cleanup

- Locked behavior with the full harness before editing.
- Pass 1, dead code: retained the reviewed deletion of one obsolete capture tool and five broken duplicate CLI-flow scripts.
- Pass 2, duplication: centralized project-source parsing plus Vite base/route handling and removed the old copies.
- Pass 3, naming/error handling: removed a needless URL wrapper, impossible drawer `isOpen` state, redundant Boolean aliases, duplicate harness reads, and an unused import.
- Pass 4, tests: added route/base safety tests and the missing project-array failure case, increasing Node coverage from 4 to 7 passing tests.
- Consolidated template documentation so README/AGENTS are canonical while wiki/skill retain only template-specific guidance.
- Final harness passed: zero audit findings, production build, 7/7 Node tests, 23/23 Playwright tests, 17/17 functional coverage, harness validation, and clean diff formatting.

### 2026-08-27 — Whole-project review remediated

- Reviewed the full application, scripts, CI, data workflow, harness, and test surface across comprehensive, security, and test-specialist lanes.
- Fixed crawlability by moving to `BrowserRouter`, path-based sitemap/canonical URLs, and generated static route entrypoints for GitHub Pages.
- Pinned CI actions, constrained screenshot navigation to approved public hosts, and made sync candidates review-only with one API request and validated writes.
- Added 4 Node regression tests, 6 core utility tests, and a seventeenth tracked browser flow; final Playwright result was 23/23 with 100% tracked functional coverage.
- Added nine preferred WebP previews with 26–95% size reductions and a 98/100 visual QA verdict.
- Deleted one obsolete capture script and five broken duplicate CLI-flow scripts; the maintained Playwright suite is now the single browser verification surface.
- Confirmed the project-data image references still resolve after the dashboard catalog update.
- Final comprehensive and security reviewers both returned APPROVE with zero remaining findings.

### 2026-08-26 — Harness runtime validation completed

- Added `tools/validate-harness-state.mjs` and the `npm run validate:harness` command so structural checks do not depend on an externally installed skill.
- Wired structural validation into `init.sh` before dependency installation and application verification.
- Executed `init.sh` through Git Bash: clean install, zero-vulnerability audit, Vite 8.2.2 build, 16/16 E2E tests, 100% functional coverage, and diff integrity all passed.
- Kept the external five-subsystem harness assessment at 100/100.

### 2026-08-26 — Bilingual repository documentation

- Kept `README.md` as the canonical English documentation.
- Added `README.zh-TW.md` with equivalent setup, architecture, deployment, project-maintenance, verification, and harness guidance.
- Added reciprocal English／繁體中文 navigation and updated feature/handoff state.
- Verified matching section structure, valid relative links, valid feature-state JSON, a 100/100 harness score, and clean diff formatting.

### 2026-08-26 — Taipei dashboards and security maintenance

- Sources checked: public `LEO0331` GitHub repository metadata, repository READMEs/package metadata, and deployed dashboards.
- Changed project catalogue: `src/data/projects.ts` and 10 matching preview images.
- Changed dependency/runtime files: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `src/routes/AppRouter.tsx`.
- Changed documentation/harness files: `README.md`, `wiki.md`, `skill.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `feature_list.json`, `init.sh`, `progress.md`, and `session-handoff.md`.
- Result: catalogue updated, audit clean, production build passing, and all E2E tests passing.

### 2026-10-01 — Project identity, content, and preview audit

- Sources checked: https://api.github.com/users/LEO0331/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated; each displayed repository's current README; GitHub redirects for sharpface, amazon-app, email_website, and RobotFriends; current public demos. Package metadata confirmed Family Cabinet uses Astro, Gridline uses React/JavaScript/Node.js/Supabase, and Boxmatch uses Flutter/Firebase.
- Project IDs updated: assistanthub, passportcomparison, simpletaxautoextraction, warmthfromafar, sharpface, warmmemo, leave-request, resume-vault, amazon-app, email-website, robotfriends, epubreader, prosemasters-skill, ppt-design-md, wordpressparser, wordpress, rednote-gallery, craftfocus, publicsafetydashboard, taipei-bin-map, genomic-data-science-with-galaxy-project, thalassemia-seq-analysis, taipei-crash-map, taipei-faith-map, taipei-1999-map, taipei-safety-map, taipei-real-estate-dashboard, toyrobot, skill-gen, boxmatch, taipei-civic-groups-map.
- Display names changed: assistanthub, passportcomparison, simpletaxautoextraction, warmthfromafar, sharpface, warmmemo, leave-request, amazon-app, email-website, robotfriends, epubreader, prosemasters-skill, ppt-design-md, wordpressparser, wordpress, rednote-gallery, publicsafetydashboard, taipei-bin-map, taipei-crash-map, taipei-faith-map, taipei-1999-map, taipei-safety-map, taipei-real-estate-dashboard, genomic-data-science-with-galaxy-project, thalassemia-seq-analysis, toyrobot, skill-gen.
- Changed files: src/data/projects.ts, src/data/projects.zh.ts, 29 PNG/WebP preview pairs under src/assets/images/projects/, tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts, tests/e2e/core-utils.spec.ts, feature_list.json, progress.md, session-handoff.md.
- Simplifications: replaced generic portfolio copy with source-backed product descriptions; retained existing IDs, localization fallback, and image resolution without new dependencies or abstractions.
- Verification: npm ci; npm audit (0 vulnerabilities); npm run sync:projects (0 updates, 0 candidates after manual curation); npm run test:unit (7/7); npm run build; npm run test:e2e (23/23, 100% tracked coverage); data uniqueness/URL/image/translation validation; visual QA of loaded captures. Three intermediate browser failures were stale content expectations and were updated; final suite passed.
- Capture recovery: waited for Flutter initialization, Render service wake-up, and large static dashboard datasets; preserved no blank or loading-only replacement images.
- Scope: no new projects, dependencies, commits, pushes, or deployment. Remaining risk: public demo cold starts and data loading; local changes await deployment.

- Final live-language check: Taipei Public Records Explorer is the current English app heading, superseding the README title Taipei Public Data Explorer; captured its loaded catalogue overview and updated the canonical display name.

- Final production spot check: CNA Practice, Family Cabinet, Competition Practice, Gridline, and WanderStamp cards show current titles, canonical repository links, decoded WebP previews, and unchanged detail slugs; renamed-project Traditional Chinese copy is present.

- Final lifecycle gate: npm run validate:harness passed (7 valid feature records); git diff --check passed. Final build passed and final E2E rerun passed 23/23 with 100% tracked coverage after the public-records title/preview update. No lint script is configured; TypeScript static checking ran through npm run build.
